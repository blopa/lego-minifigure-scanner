# Minifigure Scanner
Welcome to the Minifigure Scanner - the ultimate tool for LEGO® enthusiasts! This nifty React app lets you scan Data Matrix barcodes on LEGO® Minifigure packages to instantly identify which character you have. Say goodbye to the guesswork and hello to a seamless collecting experience.

This code was created based on the research and work of [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/18pxa7p/lego_may_be_transitioning_cmf_packaging_to/?sort=new). The code uses [this JSON](src/jsons/minifigure_series_25.json) file to match the minifugres.
